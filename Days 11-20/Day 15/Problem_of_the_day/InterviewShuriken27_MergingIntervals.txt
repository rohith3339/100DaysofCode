Interview Shuriken 27: Merging Intervals

Level MEDIUM

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given start and end points of doubt sessions for many students. The teacher can handle more than one student simultaneously. Please identify and print the time intervals for which the teacher is busy.

For example, let the given set of start and end points of sessions be {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8} }. The doubts sessions {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with each other, so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. Similarly {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}.

Follow Up: Try solving it in O(n logn), where n is the count of all sets of start and end points of sessions.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains count of all sets of start and end points of sessions. Let it be denoted by N. Each of the following N lines of input contains 2 integers. The first integer denotes the start time of session and second integer denotes the end time of session. 

Constaints:
N lies in the range: [1, 100000].
Value of start and end points of session lies in the range: [1, 1000]
Time Limit: 1 second

Output format:
Print the time intervals as described in the problem description.
